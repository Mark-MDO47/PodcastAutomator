# PodcastAutomator

This was forked, with a tip of the hat, from https://github.com/Algram/PodcastAutomator . Thanks!!

Simple bash-script to automatically download the most recent podcasts from a list of rss-feeds and upload them to your Dropbox.

The upload to your Dropbox works with the help of this script from Andrea Fabrizi: https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader
